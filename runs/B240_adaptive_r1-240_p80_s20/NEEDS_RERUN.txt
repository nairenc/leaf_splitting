IMPORTANT: This run needs to be re-executed!

The previous results in B240_adaptive_r1-240_p80_s20_results.csv were run with 
an old version of leaf_splitting_sim.py that didn't have the adaptive method 
implemented yet.

As a result, the simulation fell back to the "immediately" method, making the 
results identical to B240_immediately_r1-240_p80_s20.

To fix:
1. Make sure leaf_splitting_sim.py has the adaptive method (check: done!)
2. Delete the old results: rm results/*
3. Re-submit the job: sbatch submit_slurm.sh
4. After completion, delete this file
